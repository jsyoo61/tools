My personal tools for python programming.\

    pip install tools
    
    from tools.tools import load_pickle, save_pickle, path, tdict

Most useful functions are in `tools.tools`\
API dependent tools are in their corresponding folders: `tools.API_name` (i.e. `tools.torch.optim`)\

`scripts/` folder is not included in pip. It's just a copy-paste format 

I'm open to using my tools for any purpose as long as the user lets me know.
Please email me before using it.

If you have any questions or suggestions, I am more than happy to discuss them :smile: \
Please contact me via email or pull request. (I prefer email though)
